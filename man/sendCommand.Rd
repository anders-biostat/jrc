\title{Send a command to the server}
\usage{
sendCommand(command, sessionId = NULL, wait = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{command}{A line (or several lines separated by \code{\\n}) of JavaScript code. This code
will be immediately executed on the opened page. No R-side syntax check is performed.}

\item{sessionId}{An ID of the session to which the command should be sent. If \code{NULL}, the command will
be sent to all currently active sessions.}

\item{wait}{If \code{wait > 0}, after sending the message, R will wait for a reply for a given number of seconds. 
For this time (or until the reply is received), execution of other commands will be halted. Any incoming message 
from the session will be considered as a reply.}
}
\description{
\code{sendCommand} sends JavaScript code to the server and executes it on the currently
opened page. Use JavaScript function \code{jrc.sendCommand} to send R code from the server
and execute it in the current R session. All commands send to R from the server will be executed
only after authorization in the currently running R session.
}
\details{
Note, that in both cases commands are executed inside a function. Therefore use for R code use \code{<<-} instead
of \code{<-} to change global variables and in JavaScript use \code{windows.varibleName = "SomeValue"} or
\code{varibleName = "SomeValue"}. Variables declared like \code{var variableName = "SomeValue"} or 
\code{variableName <- "SomeValue"} will be accessible only within the current \code{sendCommand} call.

\donttest{k <- 0
openPage()
sendCommand(paste0("button = document.createElement('input');",
              "button.type = 'button';",
              "button.addEventListener('click', function() {jrc.sendCommand('k <<- k + 1')});", 
              "button.value = '+1';",
              "document.body.appendChild(button);", collapse = "\n"))
closePage()}
