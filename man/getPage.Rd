\description{
\code{jrc} offers two ways to control an interactive app. One is by using methods of classes
\code{\link{App}} and \code{\link{Session}}. This allows one to have any number of apps within one
R session, but requires some understanding of object oriented programming. Another way is to use
provided wrapper functions that are exported by the package. These functions internally work with 
the \code{\link{App}} object, which is stored in the package namespace upon initialization with 
\code{\link{openPage}} function. \code{getPage} returns this object if any.
