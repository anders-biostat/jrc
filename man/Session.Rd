\name{Session}
\alias{Session}
\title{Session class}
\description{
Objects of this class handle all the incoming and outgoing messages for one active connection.
Please, avoid creating instances of this class manually. Each \code{Session} object is created, when
a websocket is opened, and serves as a wrapper around it. Manually created object will not have
a websocket connection and thus are not functional.

All sessions are stored within an object of class \code{\link{App}} and cannot exist and function without it.
One can manipulate a session directly, using its methods that are described bellow, via methods of the corresponding 
App object, or using provided wrapper function (links to them can be found in the Methods section).
}
\section{Fields}{

\describe{
   \item{\code{id}}{
      Automatically generated ID for this session. ID is a random combination of 6 letters or numbers.
      Please, do not change value this field.
   }
   \item{\code{lastActive}}{
      Time of the last received message via the session's websocket. The time is generated by
      \code{\link[base]{Sys.time}} function.
   }
   \item{\code{startTime}}{
      Time when this session has been started (generated by \code{\link[base]{Sys.time}} function).
   }
   \item{\code{maxN}}{
      Maximum number of messages that can be simultaneously stored for this session. Must be a single number.
      If \code{maxN = 0}, any message that requires authorization will be immediately discarded.
      If message storage is full, the oldest stored message will be removed, when a new one is stored. Default 
      value is \code{Inf}. 
   }
   \item{\code{maxSize}}{
      Maximum allowed size of the message storage in bytes. Must be a single number.
      If \code{maxSize = 0}, any message that requires authorization will be immediately discarded. If message stored is full,
      older messages will be removed, until either the allowed storage size is reached, or only one message remains. Default 
      value is \code{Inf}. 
   }
}
}

\section{Methods}{

\describe{
  \item{\code{getMessageIds()}}{
     Returns IDs of all currently stored messages. ID is combination of 6 random letters and numbers,
     which is generated, when the message is stored. See also \code{\link{getMessageIds}}.
  }
  \item{\code{authorize(messageId = NULL, show = FALSE)}}{ 
     Authorizes evaluation of the message. Check \code{\link{authorize}} for more information.
  }
  \item{\code{removeMessage(messageId)}}{
     Removes a stored message. This can also be done with \code{\link{authorize}} function (set
     \code{show = TRUE} and then select to ignore message). See also \code{\link{removeMessage}}.
  }
  \item{\code{sendCommand(command, wait = 0)}}{
     Sends a JavaScript command to be evaluated on the web page. Check 
     \code{\link{sendCommand}} for more information.
  }
  \item{\code{callFunction(name, arguments = NULL, assignTo = NULL, wait = 0, thisArg = NULL,  ...)}}{
     Calls an existing JavaScript
     function on the web page. Check \code{\link{callFunction}} for more information.
  }
  \item{\code{sendData(variableName, variable, wait = 0, keepAsVector = FALSE, rowwise = TRUE)}}{
     Sends data and assigns it to 
     a variable on the web page. Check \code{\link{sendData}} for more information.
  }
  \item{\code{sendHTML(html, wait = 0)}}{
     Sends HTML code that will be appended to the web page. Check \code{\link{sendHTML}} for 
     more information.
  }
  \item{\code{sessionVariables(vars = NULL, varName = NULL)}}{
     Sets or returns variables that are used (read or rewritten) only by this session. If both arguments are
     \code{NULL}, returns environment for this session. If \code{vars} is a named list, adds this variables to the
     session environment. If \code{varName} is a character, returns a variable with this name that can be accessed from
     the session. If no such variable exists, throws an error. One can add variables to the session environment and
     get a specified one back within the same function call.Check \code{\link{setSessionVariables}} for more information.
  }
}
Note, that the \code{Session} class has some other public methods that are not mentioned in this list. These methods are
intended to be used only by other functions of \code{jrc} package and therefore are not documented.
